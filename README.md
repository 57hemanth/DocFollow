# DocFollow

DocFollow is an AI-powered patient engagement platform designed to simplify and automate the follow-up process between doctors and patients. The system is built around three core agents:

## Core Agents

-   **Follow-up Agent** – Automates patient follow-ups via WhatsApp reminders and responses, ensuring patients stay consistent with their care plans.
-   **Message Analysis Agent** – Analyzes patient-uploaded medical reports and messages, extracting key health readings and generating visual graphs for easier interpretation.
-   **Appointment Booking Agent** – Integrates with Google Calendar to enable seamless scheduling and management of follow-up visits.

Through these agents, DocFollow ensures patients remain engaged, doctors have AI assistance with full oversight (“doctor-in-loop”), and overall care delivery becomes smarter and more efficient.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

-   **Backend**: Contains the core logic, including the AI agents.
-   **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for doctors to interact with the system.
